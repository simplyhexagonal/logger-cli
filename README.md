# Logger CLI
![Tests](https://github.com/simplyhexagonal/logger-cli/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

This is a simple yet powerful wrapper around [@simplyhexagonal/logger](https://github.com/simplyhexagonal/logger) that provides
CLI capabilities, including piping the output of a command to the logger:

```sh
$ logger.debug This is a debug message

# [2022-01-13T23:54:00.600] DEBUG üêûÔ∏è:
#
#        This is a debug message

$ uname -a | logger.debug

# [2022-01-13T23:55:01.933Z] DEBUG üêûÔ∏è:
# 
#        Linux 5.11.0-40-generic #44~20.04.2-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 26 18:55:01 UTC 2022 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

More importantly, configuring transports is supported as well!

We have the following officially supported transports:

- [WebSocket]() (Coming soon)
- [Discord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@simplyhexagonal/logger-transport-discord)
- [Slack]() (Coming soon)
- [Email]() (Coming soon)
- [SMS]() (Coming soon)

## Install

```sh
pnpm i -g @simplyhexagonal/logger-cli

# or
yarn add -g @simplyhexagonal/logger-cli

# or
npm install -g @simplyhexagonal/logger-cli
```

## Usage

```sh
# simply pass your message(s) as arguments
logger.<log-level> <message> [...message]

# or pipe the output of a command to the logger
command | logger.<log-level>
```

The following log levels are supported:

```sh
logger.debug
logger.info
logger.warn
logger.error
logger.fatal
logger.all
logger.raw
```

## Configuration

By default the logger will be configured to log to the console.

To configure the logger you can use the `logger.config` command:

```sh
logger.config <config-file>.js
```

The config file is expected to be a `.js` file that exports a `config` object, e.g.:

```js
const os = require('os');

module.exports = {
  optionsByLevel: {
    warn: [], // leaving this array means the logs will output to console
    info: [
      {
        transport: 'discord',
        options: {
          destination: (process.env.DISCORD_WEBHOOK || ''),
        },
      },
    ],
    debug: [],
    error: [
      // you can configure more than one transport per log level
      {
        transport: 'discord',
        options: {
          destination: (process.env.DISCORD_WEBHOOK || ''),
        },
      },
      {
        transport: 'email',
        options: {
          destination: (process.env.ERROR_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL || ''),
        },
      },
    ],
    fatal: [],
    all: [],
    raw: [],
  },
  appIdentifiers: {
    clusterType: 'TEST',
    cluster: 'CI',
    hostname: os.hostname(),
    app: 'logger-cli',
  },
};
```

This configuration file will be symlinked to the origin directory of the logger-cli package. This means
that if you are running logger from the "global" node context, everywhere on your system that you
logger-cli commands, you will be able to use the same configuration file. On the other hand, if you
install logger-cli as a dependency to a project, only that project will be able to use the config
file (as long as the logger-cli command being run is located in the projects `node_modules` directory).

As you can see in the example above, you can also define environment variables and they will be
used by @simplyhexagonal/logger-cli.

For more information on the available configuration options, please see [@simplyhexagonal/logger](https://github.com/simplyhexagonal/logger).
